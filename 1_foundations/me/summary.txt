My name is Kyra Nankivell. I'm an entrepreneur, software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from Elora, Ontario, but I moved to Toronto in 2018.
I love all foods, particularly vegan food that doesn't pretend to be non-vegan food, and I'm strangely in love with frozen mango. I'm not against ice cream or sorbet, I just think frozen mango provides the same experience but without the additives! I make an exception for cookie dough ice cream though - frozen mango will never be able to recreate the depth of flavour found in cookie dough.
